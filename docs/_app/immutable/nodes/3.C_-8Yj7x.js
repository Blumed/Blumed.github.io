                    Day Farm grew organically from their experiences as parents
                    to seven biological and adopted kids - two of whom have
                    disabilities with unique support needs. As they raised their
                    family, the Clossers realized that their kids’ disability
                    impacts posed challenges in many traditional public
                    environments. Greg, a handy business owner, and Patty, a
                    stay-at-home parent with a creative vision, sought to build
                    a home environment that met their sons’ needs while
                    providing the space &amp; freedom to be fully themselves.</p></div> <img class="content-image svelte-13its5o" src="${Y}" alt="Having fun at a great day farm"/></div> <div class="continue-story svelte-13its5o"><p>When Patty and Greg invited their son’s special education class
                out to the family’s property, they were heartened to see how
                positively other kids with a variety of disabilities and
                accessibility needs responded to the environment. A new purpose
                was born, and the Clossers set about planning an accessible farm
                that would be intentionally designed to welcome adults and
                children with disabilities, especially those with more
                significant support needs, at no cost. As Greg put it, “You only
                live so long. I believe everyone should do something to make
                this world better. We didn’t want to leave this earth without
                doing something.”</p> <p>In 2013, Greg and Patty successfully obtained 501(c)3 status and
                quickly broke ground on a 3400 square foot accessible building
                to replace an old shed they’d repurposed on the grounds. With
                Greg’s retirement a few years later, the family launched a full
                fundraising effort to expand indoor and outdoor recreational
                amenities. These efforts allowed the Clossers to add a 3.5 acre
                fenced-in outdoor playground with walking/rolling paths, a
                pavilion, interactive play structures and more.</p> <p>Through a wide network of dedicated donors, community grants,
                and the family’s ongoing contributions, the Clossers have worked
                tirelessly to add features to the farm based on community
                feedback while ensuring the farm remains free for people with
                disabilities. The Clossers have a purpose that’s grown well
                beyond their family and is now a part of their legacy. Patty
                shares, “After moving here, where our sons had the room to run
                and feel free, a huge weight was lifted. That is the same
                feeling we hope to give everyone who visits A Great Day Farm.”</p></div></div>`,f,d,l;return s=new N({props:{title:"About Us",content:"Recreational Facility for Developmentally Disabled Individuals"}}),d=new Q({props:{title:"Come have a great day",copy:"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
