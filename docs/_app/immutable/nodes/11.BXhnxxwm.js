            have come before us. Should you feel compelled to support a new
            generation of our mission, there are many ways you can help the
            farm, whether it’s including the farm in your trust, will, estate or
            other financial plan. We know conversations around planned giving
            can be difficult and we aim to keep the process as simple as
            possible for you. The sections below are not legal advice, but can
            give you a sense of what to think about when working on your plans
            with a trusted advisor.</p> <div class="cards column-3"><article class="card"><h3>Bequests</h3> <p>You may name A Great Day Farm Foundation as a residual
                    beneficiary of an estate; as receiving a specific portion of
                    the estate; as the recipient of a specified gift; as
                    contingent beneficiary; or as one of the beneficiaries of
                    the assets of a charitable remainder trust. A bequest also
                    can be included in the body of your will or in addition to
                    it (a codicil).</p> <p>The easiest and most useful bequest to AGDF is an
                    unrestricted gift for general operating support of AGDF. The
                    following is suggested language for making an unrestricted
                    bequest in your will:</p> <blockquote class="svelte-18znh2r">“I give (the sum of ____ dollars) or ( ____ percent of the
                    residuary of my estate) to A Great Day Farm Foundation, 5575
                    115th St E, Northfield, MN 55057, for its general purposes.”</blockquote></article> <article class="card"><h3>Donor-Advised Funds</h3> <p>A Great Day Farm accepts gifts from donor-advised funds.
                    Donor-advised funds can be a flexible charitable vehicle by
                    which you contribute funds or assets (cash, stocks, bonds
                    and money in 401(k)s and IRAs, sometimes even
                    cryptocurrency) to a charitable organization.</p></article> <article class="card"><h3>Life Insurance</h3> <p>Life insurance policies and other vehicles can also be used
                    to provide charitable gifts. A Great Day Farm can be named
                    as the owner and beneficiary of a life insurance policy. The
                    donor can receive a tax deduction for the value of the
