                    as the owner and beneficiary of a life insurance policy. The

                    Donor-advised funds can be a flexible charitable vehicle by
                    which you contribute funds or assets (cash, stocks, bonds
                    and money in 401(k)s and IRAs, sometimes even
                    cryptocurrency) to a charitable organization.</p></article> <article class="card"><h3>Bequests</h3> <p>You may name A Great Day Farm Foundation as a residual
