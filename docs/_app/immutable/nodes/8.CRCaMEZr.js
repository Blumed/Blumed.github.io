            Haley is focused on building infrastructure to amplify A Great Day Farm&#39;s
            long-term community impact. She previously worked in higher education,
            corporate and nonprofit environments, all with a common thread of disability
            and accessibility. This included leading employee accessibility programs
            at Salesforce, running grants &amp; events at TASH in Washington, DC, and
            facilitating inclusive higher education environments for students and
            staff at the University of Minnesota&#39;s Disability Resource Center. Her
            work is driven by her own experiences with disability - she identifies
            as “deaf-ish” and leverages assistive technology to do her best work.</p> <p class="svelte-1ul61id"><strong class="svelte-1ul61id">John Weyland - Project Manager</strong> John supports the farm
