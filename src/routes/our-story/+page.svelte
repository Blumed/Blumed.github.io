            Founded by Greg and Patty Closser of Northfield, A Great Day Farm
            grew organically from their experiences as parents to seven
            biological and adopted kids - two of whom have disabilities with
            unique support needs. As they raised their family, the Clossers
            realized that their kids’ disability impacts posed challenges in
            many traditional public environments. Greg, a handy business owner,
            and Patty, a stay-at-home parent with a creative vision, sought to
            build a home environment that met their sons’ needs while providing
            the space & freedom to be fully themselves.

            When Patty and Greg invited a special education class out to the
            family’s property, they were heartened to see how positively + kids
            with a variety of disabilities and accessibility needs responded to
            the environment. A new purpose was born, and the Clossers set about
            planning an accessible farm that would be intentionally designed to
            welcome adults and children with disabilities, especially those with
            more significant support needs, at no cost.

            make this world better. We didn’t want to leave this earth without
            doing something.” - Greg Closser

            In 2013, Greg and Patty successfully obtained 501(c)3 status and
            quickly broke ground on a 3500 square foot accessible building to
            replace an old shed they’d repurposed on the grounds. With Greg’s
            retirement a few years later, the family launched a full fundraising
            effort to expand indoor and outdoor recreational amenities. These
            efforts allowed the Clossers to add a 3 acre fenced-in outdoor
            playground with walking/rolling paths, a pavilion, interactive play
            structures and more.

            Through a wide network of dedicated donors, community grants, and
            the family’s ongoing contributions, the Clossers have worked
            tirelessly to add features to the farm based on community feedback
            while ensuring the farm remains free for people with disabilities.
            The Clossers have a purpose that’s grown well beyond their family
            and is now a part of their legacy.

            After moving here, where our sons had the room to run and feel free,
            a huge weight was lifted. That is the same feeling we hope to give
            everyone who visits A Great Day Farm.” - Patty Closser
